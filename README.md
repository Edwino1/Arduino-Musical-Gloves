# Arduino-Musical-Gloves
A invention that allows you to create music with just your fingers. The pitch was controlled by 
            the flexing of the fingers and the orientation of the hand. The idea is to have the hands mimic
            what it would be like to play that instrument and then have the gloves create that instrument. A gyroscope was 
            used to calculate the orietnation of the hands to achieve this.
            For example, if the hands were positioned as if one were to play the piano, the glove would mimic
            a piano. If the hands were positioned to play the bass, the glove would mimic playing the bass. The 
            video above shows how this would work.
